                      <p>There is a lot of vitamin A in dates. This vitamin helps your cornea regenerate and protects the eyes. They also contain lutein and zeaxanthin, which are both nutrients that allow your eyes to better filter out harmful UV-rays. This means that your eyes remain "fresh" longer and better maintain their capacity.</p>

                      <p>When you get a hangover from drinking too much alcohol, combat its effects by applying honey remedy. Honey is gentle on the stomach and contains a mix of natural sugars such fructose which is known to speed up the oxidation of alcohol by the liver, acting as a 'sobering' agent. Follow this recipe: 15ml of liquid honey with 80ml of orange juice and 70ml of natural yogurt. Blend them together until smooth.</p>

                      <p>One of the better known health benefits of honey is that it is able to help treat sore throats. Thanks to its antimicrobial properties, honey not only soothes throats but can also kill certain bacteria that causes the infection. Professional singers commonly use honey to soothe their throats before performances. The Chinese believe that excess "heatiness" in the body causes sore throat and taking honey drink can be helpful. Direction: Take a spoonful of honey to soothe the inflammation or gargle with a mixture of two tablespoons of honey, four tablespoons of lemon juice and a pinch of salt. Personally, whenever I have a sore throat or cough, I especially like to take warm water mixed with Manuka UMF honey which is well-known for its anti-bacterial healing properties.</p>

                      A Sweet, Sweet Summer: Why is White Sugar Bad For You?</p>

                      <p>We put it in coffee, get tempted by it in desserts, and hardly even know how often it’s added into savory processed foods. Sugar certainly makes life sweeter, but is it also the underlying villain in nutrition?
                      </p>
                      <p>There are plenty of reasons white, refined sugar will hurt you when you eat it. Some describe it as nothing short of a poison, while for others, it’s a compromise food to be eaten in moderation. Surprisingly, this site even deems sugar as not bad for you at all, just a source of carbohydrates, a “basic fuel for the body.” Perhaps that site is funded by the sugar companies…or the U.S. Government.</p>

                      <p>One of my goals in the Sweet, Sweet Summer series is to explore whether there really are “more natural” sweeteners and “healthier” sweeteners than refined white sugar. Before I tackle that big issue, which has intimidated me for a long time, I think it’s important to lay the foundation of why we’re even asking those questions.
                      </p>
                      <p><strong>Is White Sugar Bad for You?</strong>            </p>
                      <p>Because bad bacteria love to eat sugars, sugar can depress your immune system by fueling the bad guys, just as eating yogurt and other fermented foods help feed the “good guys” with probiotics.<br>
                      Sugar contributes to infertility
                      Sugars increase blood glucose levels, which can deteriorate blood vessels and lead to heart disease.
                      Sugar may increase your risk of many cancers (dare I say “cause cancer?”).(says to make sure to eat sugars with sources of fat, protein and fiber to reduce insulin production)
                      However, this large research study from the Netherlands discredits the face that sugar is linked to cancer at all.<br>
                      My favorite article on the subject of sugar, period, is this one by Gary Taubes in the New York Times. Way down at the bottom, after a very thorough investigation of the subject of sugar and disease, he says:
                      “The connection between obesity, diabetes and cancer was first reported in 2004 in large population studies by researchers from the World Health Organization’s International Agency for Research on Cancer. It is not controversial.” Therefore, if you can accept that sugar increases obesity or diabetes, then sugar increases one’s risk of cancer. It’s a really good article, but not for the faint of heart.</p>
                      <p>Sugar contributes to candida, a yeast overgrowth in the body.
                      Sugar is addictive</p>
                      <p>Why is this? Lisa Byrne explains it in her workbook Break the Sugar Habit: “Refined, white sugar acts more like a drug than a food in our system…but it started as a whole plant. The sugar cane and beet plant in nature come complete with vitamins, minerals, fiber, and phytochemicals like any other plant. And they have carbohydrates like any other plant in the form of [sucrose]. When sugar is refined they strip the sugar cane plant or beet plant of all its natural components, except the [sucrose]. Then [sucrose]is concentrated into what we know as table sugar.This means we take [sucrose] out of its natural balance found in plants…and that is an important part of understanding why it impacts our body so differently.
                      When [sucrose]is part of the whole food it acts like a food in your body, entering our system calmly, breaking down slowly and providing a range of nutrients in addition to energy.
                      </p>
                      <p>When [sucrose]is isolated, sugar acts like a drug in your body. Too much refined sugar creates a cycle of intense highs and lows, keeping our blood sugar, hormones and neurotransmitters out of balance.</p>
                      <p>Some may tell you that sugar’s not addictive, but I dare you: cut out all refined sugars for a few days. Just see if you don’t have cravings and possibly even withdrawal symptoms! Better yet, cut out all sweeteners. I dare ya.
                      Sugar cravings are related to stress and self-sustaining. (Meaning when you eat sugar because you’re stressed, you’re going to end up wanting more sugar when the stress returns.)</p>

                      <p>The high potassium content will not only help your heart but also curb atherosclerosis. This vascular disease is due to calcium deposited on the vessel walls. This not only narrows the arteries, but also carries the risk in the form of potential blockages. This increases the risk of strokes, heart attacks and other diseases enormously. Eating three dates each day will make a big difference and help keep your vessels clear.</p>

                      <p>For thousands of years, honey has been recognized as one of the most natural home remedies to treat a wide range of ailments and complaints including yeast infection, athlete foot, and arthritis pain. Its antiseptic properties inhibits the growth of certain bacteria and helps keep external wounds clean and free from infection. Honey has been used as a natural cure in first aid treatment for wounds, burns and cuts as it is able to absorb moisture from the air and promote healing. Its antibacterial properties prevent infection and functions as an anti-inflammatory agent, reducing both swelling and pain, and even scarring. It is widely believed that UMF Manuka is the preferred honey for wound dressing due to its strong antibacterial property.</p>

                      If you`re a T2 diabetic do not let the American Diabetes Association (ADA) ,  or any doctor on planet earth tell you that T2 diabetes is a progressive disease.  Do not let these people tell you that a Hemoglobin A1C of 7% is normal for a diabetic, my former doctor was perfectly fine with Hemoglobin A1C levels of 8%.
                      </p>
                      <p>A Hemoglobin A1C of 7% is an estimated average blood glucose of 172 mg/dl, 9.55 mmol .  A blood glucose of 172 mg/dl is more than double normal. <br>
                      A Hemoglobin A1C of 8% is an estimated average blood glucose of 208 mg/dl, 11.56 mmol .</p>
                      <p>If you listen to the American Diabetes Association,  or any doctor on planet earth that follows the protocol of the American Diabetes Association, you are destined to live a shorter life, you are destined to live a life filled with all of the complications that come from very high blood glucose and continuous high levels of insulin.  This is just a short list from WIKIPEDIA of some of the symptoms that can occur from diabetes and high blood sugar and high insulin  levels.</p>
                      <p>The damage to small blood vessels leads to a microangiopathy, which can cause one or more of the following:</p>
                      <p>Diabetic cardiomyopathy, damage to the heart muscle, leading to impaired relaxation and filling of the heart with blood (diastolic dysfunction) and eventually heart failure; this condition can occur independent of damage done to the blood vessels over time from high levels of blood glucose.[26]</p>
                      <p> Diabetic nephropathy, damage to the kidney which can lead to chronic renal failure, eventually requiring dialysis. Diabetes mellitus is the most common cause of adult kidney failure in the developed world.</p>
                      <p> Diabetic neuropathy, abnormal and decreased sensation, usually in a 'glove and stocking' distribution starting with the feet but potentially in other nerves, later often fingers and hands. When combined with damaged blood vessels this can lead to diabetic foot (see below). Other forms of diabetic neuropathy may present as mononeuritis or autonomic neuropathy. Diabetic amyotrophy is muscle weakness due to neuropathy.
                      </p>
                      <p>Diabetic retinopathy, growth of friable and poor-quality new blood vessels in the retina as well as macular edema (swelling of the macula), which can lead to severe vision loss or blindness. Retinal damage (from microangiopathy) makes it the most common cause of blindness among non-elderly adults in the US.</p>
                      <p>Diabetic encephalopathy[27] is the increased cognitive decline and risk of dementia- including (but not limited to) the Alzheimer's type- observed in diabetes. Various mechanisms are proposed, including alterations to the vascular supply of the brain and the interaction of insulin with the brain itself.
                      Macrovascular disease leads to cardiovascular disease, to which accelerated atherosclerosis is a contributor:</p>
                      <p>Coronary artery disease, leading to angina or myocardial infarction ("heart attack")</p>
                      <p>Diabetic myonecrosis ('muscle wasting')</p>
                      <p> Peripheral vascular disease, which contributes to intermittent claudication (exertion-related leg and foot pain) as well as diabetic foot.[30]
                      </p>
                      <p> Stroke (mainly the ischemic type)
                      </p>
                      <p>Diabetic foot, often due to a combination of sensory neuropathy (numbness or insensitivity) and vascular damage, increases rates of skin ulcers (diabetic foot ulcers) and infection and, in serious cases, necrosis and gangrene. It is why diabetics are prone to leg and foot infections and why it takes longer for them to heal from leg and foot wounds. It is the most common cause of non-traumatic adult amputation, usually of toes and or feet, in the developed world.</p>
                      <p>Carotid artery stenosis does not occur more often in diabetes, and there appears to be a lower prevalence of abdominal aortic aneurysm. However, diabetes does cause higher morbidity, mortality and operative risks with these conditions.</p>
                      <p>In the developed world, diabetes is the most significant cause of adult blindness in the non-elderly and the leading cause of non-traumatic amputation in adults, and diabetic nephropathy is the main illness requiring renal dialysis in the United States.[32].

                      <p>The photo that I have provide was taken at 2:55 PM on April 28th.  This is my usual blood glucose reading in the mid afternoon.  I was diagnosed with T2 diabetes at the age of 45 with a fasting blood glucose of 300 mg/dl, 16.67 mmol .  Also with a Hemoglobin A1C of 12.0, which is an estimated average blood glucose of 350 mg/dl, 19.44 mmol .  My current hemoglobin A1C is 4.8%, which is an estimated average blood glucose of 92 mg/dl.  I take no diabetes medications, I follow a very low carb, proper protein, SOME healthy fats diet.  I am 57 years old, I started a low carb  ketogenic diet back in November of 2012.  </p>

                      <p> I am convinced that because of the many health problems that I was faced with,  Had I continued to listen to my ADA endocronoligist and continued to follow their recommendations of a very high carbohydrate diet, I would be dead today.

                      <p>A very low carb, proper protein, some healthy fats ketogenic diet saved my life, it can save your life as well.</p>

                      "Cardiovascular diseases can be considered the most important cause of death in diabetic population and diabetes can in turn increase the risk of cardiovascular events. Inflammation process is currently recognized as responsible for the development and maintenance of diverse chronic diseases, including diabetes and atherosclerosis. Considering that adipose tissue is an important source of adipokines, which may present anti and proinflammatory effects, the aim of this review is to explore the role of the main adipokines in the pathophysiology of diabetes and atherosclerosis, highlighting the therapeutic options that could arise from the manipulation of these signaling pathways both in humans and in translational models.</p>

                      <p>The authors evaluated the relationship between dietary sodium, potassium, and high systolic blood pressure among 4716 adolescents aged 12 to 14 years who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 1999 to 2012.</p>

                      <p>However, participants who reported sodium intake 7500 mg/d, potassium  or sodium-potassium ratio 2.5 had increased odds for high systolic blood pressure 95th percentile for age, sex, and height). Although the high sodium and low potassium groups did not overlap, 49.2% of these adolescents also had a sodium-potassium ratio.</p>

                      <p>There was no association with blood pressure across most values of sodium or potassium intake. </p>
                      <p>"In young adolescents, both excessive sodium and limited potassium are associated with high systolic blood pressure, but the balance between sodium and potassium intake may be more useful in explaining blood pressure in this population," the authors summarize.</p>
